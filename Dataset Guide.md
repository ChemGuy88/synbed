1. <a name="noteCIDvsSID"></a>The prefix `CID` actually stands for "Compound ID", and should be distinguinshed from another chemical ID prefix (not in this dataset), `SID`, which stands for "Substance ID". These are PubChem conventions.
1. <a name="noteFileLegibility"></a> The file is not spaced as shown. The file is tab-delimited or space delimited. The spacing was added for better legibility.
